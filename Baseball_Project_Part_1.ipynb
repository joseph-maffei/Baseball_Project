    "The first professional baseball league was created in 1871, and the sport has been at the forefront of American entertainment and culture for over 150 years.  Although the framework of the game has remained unchanged, shifts in overall game strategy, team management, and player skillsets have evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined in 1980 by the godfather of baseball analytics Bill James as \"the search for objective knowledge about baseball\", sabremetrics has for decades impacted how team owners and front offices evaulate players and construct teams.  With the advent of high speed cameras and other technological advancements that enable the tracking of pitch movement and the launch angles of batted balls an entire new regime of data, and tons of it, are now available.  The influx has turned baseball managers into part time data analysts and the increasing reliance on analytics to evaulate players has caused some of this terminology and thought process to bleed into discourse of the common fan, something not even the biggest baseball nerd could have predicted 15 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, several publically available sources of baseball data now exist on the web, including the well known website 'Fangraphs' which provides hundreds of team and individual player metrics as well as analytically minded articles.  Using this and other sources I thought it would be interesting to see how well the available data could help us predict the winner of baseball's World Series.\n",

    "The first step of the project is to define the objective(s) of the analysis.  For this project I intend to develop a model that, using a priori data, is capable of predicting who will win the 2018 World Series.  To accomplish this I will use yearly full-season batting statistics for each team from the year 2000 to the current year, 2018.  Because we already know who has won the World Series from 2000 to 2017, we can use machine learning to develop a model to predict the outcome of this year's championship.  The batting statistics will be obtained as .csv files from Fangraphs.  The information on which team won the World Series each year is obtained from another online source called the Lahman Database.  Since we will be using data from two different sources together it will be important to first load the data, and re-organize it to resolve formatting differeces between the two databases."
